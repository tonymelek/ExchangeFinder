# ExchangeFinder
## Description
This Repo is a simple application that uses googlesheet single table as a database, having information about Telstra Exchange Locations in Victoria, inluding 
* Exchange name 
* 4 Alpha code 
* Address 
* Coordinates (longitude and latitude).

The application uses gscipt as a backend where the table can be converted to a `JSON` object and imported to the browser on file being loaded.


## Usage
Use the search bar to type an Exchange name or part of it to start search and with every key stroke the webpage updates itself with number of results found and displays them in a table below it.

**Note:** The search text is not case sensetive.
